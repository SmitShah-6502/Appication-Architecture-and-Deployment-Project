# Patient Readmission Prediction API

## Problem Statement
Hospitals and healthcare providers strive to minimize patient readmissions, as frequent readmissions can indicate ineffective treatment and lead to increased healthcare costs. Identifying high-risk patients at the time of discharge enables hospitals to optimize resource allocation and improve patient care. 

This project aims to build a **Patient Readmission Prediction API** that leverages machine learning to classify whether a patient is likely to be readmitted within **30 days** based on their medical data. 

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is an open-source healthcare dataset or a synthetic dataset that includes:
- **Patient demographics** (e.g., age, gender)
- **Medical history** (e.g., previous diagnoses, lab test results)
- **Hospitalization details** (e.g., length of stay, number of procedures, medications prescribed)
- **Previous readmission records**

##Data Description
1. time_in_hospital (Integer)
Represents the number of days the patient stayed in the hospital.
Higher values may indicate more severe conditions or complications.
2. n_lab_procedures (Integer)
Total number of lab tests conducted during the patient's hospital stay.
More tests might indicate a thorough examination or complex health conditions.
3. n_procedures (Integer)
Total number of medical procedures performed on the patient.
Higher values may suggest a more severe illness or multiple interventions.
4. n_medications (Integer)
Number of different medications prescribed to the patient.
Can indicate the complexity of treatment or multiple health conditions.
5. n_outpatient (Integer)
Number of outpatient visits before hospitalization.
Frequent visits may suggest ongoing medical conditions or preventive care.
6. n_inpatient (Integer)
Number of previous inpatient admissions.
Higher numbers may indicate chronic conditions or recurring health issues.
7. n_emergency (Integer)
Number of emergency visits before hospitalization.
Frequent ER visits could suggest poor health management or critical conditions.
8. medical_specialty (Hashed Integer)
Encodes the specialty of the doctor or department handling the patient (e.g., cardiology, endocrinology).
Since it's a categorical variable, it's converted using a hash function (hash(data["medical_specialty"]) % 1000).
9. diag_1 (Hashed Integer)
Represents the primary diagnosis code assigned to the patient.
Encoded using a hash function (hash(data["diag_1"]) % 1000) to ensure consistent numerical representation.
10. diag_2 (Hashed Integer)
Represents the secondary diagnosis code (if applicable).
Also hashed similarly to diag_1.
11. diag_3 (Hashed Integer)
Represents the tertiary (third) diagnosis code.
Encoded using hashing like diag_1 and diag_2.
12. glucose_test (Binary: 0 or 1)
Indicates whether a glucose test was performed.
1 = Test performed, 0 = No test.
13. A1Ctest (Binary: 0 or 1)
Indicates whether an A1C test (used to check diabetes control) was performed.
1 = Test performed, 0 = No test.
14. change (Binary: 0 or 1)
Indicates whether medication was changed during the hospital stay.
1 = Yes, 0 = No.
15. diabetes_med (Binary: 0 or 1)
Indicates whether the patient was prescribed diabetes medication.
1 = Yes, 0 = No.

## Project Workflow
This project follows a structured pipeline for development and deployment:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Develop the Flask API (`app.py`)**: 
   - The API accepts patient details (e.g., age, diagnosis, hospital stay duration, and test results).
   - It processes the input and returns a prediction on whether the patient is likely to be readmitted within 30 days.
   
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Dockerize the Application**:
   - Containerize the Flask API using Docker.
   - Test the container locally to ensure smooth execution.
   
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Deploy the API using Docker Hub**:
   - Push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
   - Pull and run the container from Docker Hub on a new machine.
   
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Deploy the API on AWS EC2**:
   - Configure an AWS EC2 instance.
   - Pull the Docker image and run the API, making it accessible via the cloud.

## Features
‚úÖ Accepts patient data via a JSON request.
‚úÖ Preprocesses input features (e.g., encoding categorical values, scaling numerical data).
‚úÖ Predicts hospital readmission using a trained machine learning model.
‚úÖ Returns both the prediction outcome and probability score (if available).
‚úÖ Deployed as a **REST API** for seamless integration.
